# DoBoard — Collaborative To-Do PWA

> **Claude Code context file.** Read this before every phase. Update task checkboxes and phase status as you complete work.

---

## Project Overview

A real-time collaborative to-do list PWA. Users create boards (categories), add tasks, invite teammates, and collaborate live (like Google Docs). Each board has a progress tracker with charts and insights. Built to be installable as a PWA on desktop and mobile.

## Tech Stack

## Firestore Data Model

### `users/{userId}`
```ts
{
  uid: string
  name: string
  email: string
  avatarUrl: string | null
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### `boards/{boardId}`
```ts
{
  name: string
  color: string               // hex e.g. "#378ADD"
  members: string[]           // array of userIds
  createdBy: string           // userId
  createdAt: Timestamp
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### `tasks/{taskId}`
```ts
{
  boardId: string
  title: string
  description: string | null
  done: boolean
  doneAt: Timestamp | null
  assignee: string | null     // userId
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | null
  dueDate: Timestamp | null
  archived: boolean
  createdBy: string           // userId
  createdAt: Timestamp
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### `presence/{userId}_{boardId}`
```ts
{
  userId: string
  boardId: string
  lastSeen: Timestamp
}
```

## Firestore Security Rules

Apply these rules in Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /boards/{boardId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null
        && request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      // Allow current members to update, and allow a signed-in user to add
      // themselves via an invite link (self-join through arrayUnion).
      allow update: if request.auth != null
        && (request.auth.uid in resource.data.members
            || request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.members);
      allow delete: if request.auth != null
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.createdBy;
    }

    match /tasks/{taskId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    match /presence/{presenceId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Phase 0 — Setup & Foundation

**Goal:** Scaffold the full project with all dependencies, folder structure, Firebase config, routing, and placeholder pages. After this phase the app should start without errors.

### Tasks
- [x] Init Vite + React + TypeScript: `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`
- [x] Install dependencies:
  ```
  npm install firebase react-router-dom recharts react-hot-toast date-fns
  npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite-plugin-pwa
  npx tailwindcss init -p
  ```
- [x] Configure `tailwind.config.js` — set content paths to `./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
- [x] Add Tailwind directives to `src/index.css`
- [x] Create `src/lib/firebase.ts` — init Firebase app, export `auth`, `db` using `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_*` variables
- [x] Create `src/types/index.ts` — export TypeScript interfaces: `User`, `Board`, `Task`, `Presence`
- [x] Create `src/lib/utils.ts` — helper: `getInitials(name: string): string`, `formatRelativeDate(date: Date): string`
- [x] Set up React Router v6 in `App.tsx` — routes: `/login`, `/` (Dashboard), `/board/:boardId` (BoardDetail), `/join/:boardId` (Join board)
- [x] Create placeholder components: `LoginPage.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `BoardDetail.tsx` — each just renders its name in an `<h1>`
- [x] Create `ProtectedRoute.tsx` — redirect to `/login` if no auth user
- [x] Create `.env.example` with all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variable names, empty values
- [x] Verify `npm run dev` starts without errors

  - `onSnapshot` query on `boards` where `members array-contains currentUser.uid`
  - Returns `{ boards, loading }`
- [x] Create `src/hooks/useTasks.ts` (basic version — count only):
  - For each boardId, query tasks where `boardId == id` and `archived == false`
  - Returns task counts per board (total and done) — used for progress bars on cards
- [x] Create `src/components/shared/ProgressBar.tsx` — props: `value` (0–100), `color` (hex)
- [x] Create `src/components/shared/Avatar.tsx` — shows initials circle, props: `name`, `size`, `color`, optional `online` (green dot)
- [x] Create `src/components/boards/BoardCard.tsx`:
  - Color dot + board name
  - "X of Y done" text
  - `ProgressBar` component
  - Stacked member avatars (max 3 shown, then "+N")
  - Click navigates to `/board/:boardId`
  - Hover: subtle lift effect

  - Text input for board name
  - 8 preset color swatches to pick from
  - Create button → adds board to Firestore with `members: [currentUser.uid]`
  - Cancel/close
- [x] Build `Dashboard.tsx` full layout:
  - Header: "DoBoard" logo, "+ New Board" button (opens modal), user avatar + sign out
  - Responsive 2-col card grid (1-col on mobile)
  - Empty state: "No boards yet — create one to get started"
  - Loading skeleton (3 gray card placeholders while loading)
- [x] Verify: can create board, see it on dashboard with progress bar, click to navigate
- [x] Update Phase 2 status in this file to ✅ Done
- [x] Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Phase 2 — boards dashboard with CRUD"`

---

## Phase 3 — Tasks — Core CRUD + Real-time

- [x] Update Phase 3 status in this file to ✅ Done
- [x] Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Phase 3 — tasks CRUD with real-time onSnapshot"`

---

## Phase 4 — Task Enhancements

**Goal:** Assignee, due dates, priority, notes, archive — all editable in a slide-in task detail panel.

### Tasks
- [x] Create `src/components/tasks/TaskDetailPanel.tsx` — slides in from right (or bottom on mobile) when a task row is clicked:
  - Editable title input
  - Textarea for description/notes

- [x] Archived tasks query: separate hook call with `archived == true`
- [x] Update Phase 4 status in this file to ✅ Done
- [x] Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Phase 4 — task enhancements: assignee, due dates, priority, archive"`

---

## Phase 5 — Collaboration

**Goal:** Invite members by link or email, online presence, member management.

### Tasks
- [x] Create `src/hooks/usePresence.ts`:
  - On BoardDetail mount: write `presence/{uid}_{boardId}` with `lastSeen: serverTimestamp()` every 30s using `setInterval`
  - Clean up interval on unmount
  - Listen to all presence docs for current board's members
  - Return `onlineUserIds: string[]` (lastSeen within 60 seconds)
- [x] Update `BoardCard.tsx`: show "X online" green badge if `onlineUserIds.length > 0`

- [x] Invite by link:
  - "Invite" button in BoardDetail header → opens invite modal
  - Generate shareable URL: `${window.location.origin}/join/${boardId}`
  - "Copy link" button (uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText`)
  - Toast: "Link copied!"
- [x] Join board page (`/join/:boardId`):
  - If not logged in → redirect to login, then return here
  - If already a member → redirect to `/board/:boardId`
  - If new → show "You've been invited to [Board Name]" with "Join Board" button
  - On join: `arrayUnion(currentUser.uid)` on board's `members` field
- [x] Invite by email:
  - In invite modal: email input → search `users` collection by email
  - If found: add their uid to `members[]` with `arrayUnion`
  - If not found: show "User not found — they need to sign in first"
- [x] Member management (in board settings modal):
  - List all members (name + avatar + "online" badge)
  - Board creator can remove members (`arrayRemove`)
  - Leave board option for non-creators
- [x] Update Phase 5 status in this file to ✅ Done
- [x] Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Phase 5 — collaboration: invite, presence, member management"`

## Phase 6 — Progress Tracker & Insights

**Goal:** Per-board insights tab with charts, stats, and a health summary.

### Tasks
- [x] Add "Insights" tab to `BoardDetail.tsx` filter bar (next to All/Active/Done/Archived)
- [x] Create `src/components/insights/InsightsPanel.tsx`
- [x] Stat cards row (4 cards):
  - Total tasks
  - Done (count + %)
  - Active (not done, not archived)
  - Overdue (due < now, not done)
- [x] Completion rate donut chart (Recharts `PieChart`):
  - Done (board color) vs Remaining (gray)
  - Center label: "X% done"
- [x] Tasks completed over last 7 days (Recharts `BarChart` or `LineChart`):
  - X axis: last 7 days (Mon, Tue... formatted with `date-fns format(day, 'EEE')`)
  - Y axis: count of tasks where `doneAt` falls on that day
  - Bar color: board color
- [x] Priority breakdown (Recharts `BarChart`, horizontal):
  - Three bars: High / Medium / Low
  - Colors: red / amber / gray
  - Label: count on each bar
- [x] Member contribution (Recharts `BarChart`):
  - X axis: member names (initials or first name)
  - Y axis: tasks completed by that member (where `done == true` and `createdBy` or `assignee == uid`)
- [x] Board health summary text block at top of InsightsPanel:
  - If 0 overdue: "All on track"
  - If overdue > 0: "X tasks are overdue"
  - If completion > 80%: "Great progress on this board!"
  - If all done: "Board complete!"
- [x] Verify all charts render correctly with real data
- [x] Update Phase 6 status in this file to ✅ Done
- [x] Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Phase 6 — progress tracker and insights with charts"`

## Phase 7 — PWA + Polish

**Goal:** Installable PWA, offline support, toast notifications, loading states, mobile polish.

### Tasks
- [ ] Configure `vite-plugin-pwa` in `vite.config.ts`:
  ```ts
  VitePWA({
    registerType: 'autoUpdate',
    manifest: {
      name: 'DoBoard',
      short_name: 'DoBoard',
      theme_color: '#6366f1',
      background_color: '#ffffff',
      display: 'standalone',
      icons: [{ src: '/icon-192.png', sizes: '192x192', type: 'image/png' }, { src: '/icon-512.png', sizes: '512x512', type: 'image/png' }]
    },
    workbox: { globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}'] }
  })
  ```
- [ ] Create simple app icons: `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png` (use a simple colored square with "DB" text via Canvas or a placeholder)
- [ ] Add `react-hot-toast` `<Toaster>` to `App.tsx`
- [ ] Add toast notifications to all actions: task added, task deleted, board created, board deleted, member invited, link copied, error states
- [ ] Create `src/components/shared/Skeleton.tsx` — gray animated pulse blocks in card shape and row shape
- [ ] Use `Skeleton` in `BoardGrid` (while loading boards) and `TaskList` (while loading tasks)
- [ ] Empty states:
  - Dashboard: illustration + "Create your first board to get started"
  - Task list: "No tasks yet — add one above"
  - Insights: "Add some tasks to see insights"
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness audit:
  - Dashboard: 1-col on mobile, 2-col on md+
  - BoardDetail: full screen, bottom sheet for TaskDetailPanel on mobile
  - Touch targets: all interactive elements min 44×44px
  - Bottom padding on mobile for safe area
- [ ] Route-level code splitting: wrap all page imports in `React.lazy` + `<Suspense>`
- [ ] Final check: `npm run build` succeeds, `npm run preview` shows PWA
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel: `npx vercel --prod` (or via GitHub auto-deploy)
- [ ] Update Phase 7 status in this file to ✅ Done
- [ ] Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: Phase 7 — PWA config, polish, and production build"`

## Notes & Decisions

_Add notes as the project evolves._

- Board deletion should also delete all tasks with that boardId (use a batch delete or Cloud Function)
- Task query uses `boardId` field — add a Firestore composite index on `(boardId, archived, createdAt)` if Firestore prompts for it
- Presence cleanup: docs are small, no need to delete on logout — TTL of 60s handles it
- Member contribution chart uses `assignee` field if set, otherwise `createdBy`
- **Phase 5:** The `boards` update rule was widened so a signed-in user can self-join via an invite link (they aren't a member yet when joining). Apply the updated rules block above in the Firebase console.
- **Phase 5:** Email invites match on a lowercased `email` field; `AuthContext` now stores email lowercased. Existing user docs created before this change may need their email normalized for lookup to find them.
- Presence uses `presence/{uid}_{boardId}` docs; `usePresence` queries by `boardId` (single field, no composite index needed) and treats `lastSeen` within 60s as online.
- **Phase 6:** Firestore rules and composite indexes are now managed in-repo (`firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`) and were deployed to `doboard-7e6ba` via `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes`. The widened self-join board rule is live. Indexes: `boards(members array-contains, updatedAt desc)` and `tasks(boardId asc, archived asc, createdAt asc)`.
- **Phase 6:** Insights compute from the active (non-archived) task list, so archiving done tasks removes them from the stat cards and charts. Member contribution attributes each completed task to its `assignee`, falling back to `createdBy`.
